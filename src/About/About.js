        I’m a Software Engineer. The most recent project I’ve worked on is the LoveBank project described here. In terms of proficiency, I have played around with a large handful of different languages, but my most proficient are higher-level languages such as Ruby, Python, or Javascript. I can also program well in C, although I do prefer the extra freedom that higher-level languages grant. I also tend towards the Functional Programming paradigm.

        I started out as a farmer, strangely enough. Additionally, I have been both a welder and an english professor in the past. In terms of programming, I’ve been self-learning in the field for 10 years. For the last one and a half years, I’ve been at Holberton School of Software Engineering after having made the decision to go there in order to improve my professional skills as well as to increase my network.

        I am motivated by elegant and working solutions. Quite often, that means I’m driven to find creative solutions to unusual problems. As a part of a team, I am unafraid of thinking laterally and challenging assumptions in order to view a problem from many diverse perspectives instead of simply through the lens of an accepted solution or methodology.
